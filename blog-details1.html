            <p>I personally find it confusing with all the geeky terms and specs that I have to deal with when buying
                computers. I’ve always wanted to know the meaning behind these terms and how exactly it affects my
                computer of choice. Here is an overview of the most important specs and details you need to keep your
                eye on when it comes to computers.</p>

            <h2>The Motherboard</h2>
            <p>
                A motherboard provides connectivity between the hardware components of a computer, like the processor
                (CPU), memory (RAM), hard drive, and video card. There are multiple types of motherboards, designed to
                fit different types and sizes of computers.
            </p>
            <p>
                Buses are circuits on the motherboard that connect the CPU to other components. A bus moves instructions
                and
                data around the system. The faster the bus, the faster data is communicated. The speed of the
                motherboard is
                defined by the bus speed it is measured in megahertz (MHz).
            </p>
            <p>

                The bus’s job is to get the data that the CPU needs. The bus does not increase or decrease the CPU’s
                speed,
                but handles that data that flows in and out of the device, which plays a key role in how well the CPU
                performs.
            </p>
            <h2>Processor</h2>
            <p>Think of the computer’s processor like a brain . A computer with a good processor can run programs no
                problem, and boot up in a flash.</p>
            <p>
                Processor specs are labeled in terms of the number of cores, and the clock speed (in GHz or gigahertz).
                The
                speed indicates the amount of data that can be processed in a specific amount of time the bigger the
                number,
                the better. The cores act as multipliers. For example, a 3GHz processor with a single-core is six times
                slower than a six-core 3GHz processor. Multiple cores can also help with multi-tasking, as each can be
                working on different tasks. If you don’t use a lot of programs at the same time, you may be content with
                just one or two cores.
            </p>
            <p>
                Check out CPU Benchmark, it allows you to compare CPU’s of multiple machines. A cache is a hardware or
                software component that stores data so that future requests for that data can be served faster. Here,
                the
                L1, L2, and L3 cache sizes are the closest and fastest memory spaces to the CPU and the bigger they are,
                the
                better. You can also see how many threads the core has the more, the better.
            </p>

            <h2> RAM — Random Access Memory</h2>
            <p>The RAM is where active data from your applications and system processes are stored. Think of RAM as the
                temporary canvas or scratchpad where a computer does its real-time calculations and operations. The
                amount
                of Random Access Memory, or RAM, in a computer can affect just how much multitasking it can handle and
                how
                fast it will be. RAM is basically a small, extra-fast form of memory.</p>
            <p>
                With today’s memory-hungry applications and web browsers, computers need more RAM than ever before. If
                you
                tend to use multiple open apps at the same time, then the more RAM your computer has, the better.
                If you’re shopping around for a new computer, always go for at least 8GB of RAM. If you are a gamer,
                photo
                or video editor, or planning to do CAD/CAM work, you need at least 16GB of Ram.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you check out the specifics of the RAM in a computer and see that it’s DDR2–800, then this is a
                faster
                memory than one labeled DDR2–400, as that last number signifies how many millions of data transfers the
                RAM
                can make each second.
            </p>
            <p>
                RAM also has clock speeds, similar to processors. However, that speed is limited to the speed of your
                computer’s motherboard, so if you’re buying RAM separately from your computer, figure out the speed of
                your
                motherboard and don’t buy RAM that’s any faster it will probably cost you more for no reason and don’t
                buy
                RAM any slower as it will force your motherboard to run at the slower speed.
            </p>
            <h2>Storage</h2>

            <p>Every computer needs data storage, and though that is something RAM does, the majority of it will go onto
                your hard drive. There are three types of storage: HDD (hard disk drive) and SSD (solid state drive) and
                hybrids.</p>
            <p>HDDs still use rapidly spinning magnetic disks called “platters” to store information while SSDs use
                flash
                memory. Computers with SSDs have much faster read and write rates than computers with conventional HDDs.
                SSDs don’t have moving parts too so they’re lighter, cooler, quieter, more efficient and are harder to
                damage than a conventional drive.</p>
            <p> With these advantages, always choose a computer with an SSD over one with a conventional hard drive.
                They
                might be more expensive but their speed and efficiency are definitely worth the difference.</p>
            <p>Some computers combine the best of both worlds with hybrid drives. These combine a small SSD and a large
                HDD
                in a single package. While hybrids aren’t as fast as a true SSD, they are less expensive and hold more.
                The faster the spin speed of your hard drive disk, the quicker information can be gathered from it. So,
                between a 5400rpm drive and a 7200rpm drive, the second would be faster. Some applications may even be
                able
                to run from an external hard drive. You’ll also want to pay attention to data transfer bandwidth. The
                higher, the better.</p>
            <p>
                You can always expand your storage space with a memory card, external drive or even replace the entire
                drive
                if needed. You could also use cloud storage in addition to your local drive.
            </p>

            <h2>GPU</h2>
            <p>Integrated GPUs are built into the computer’s processor and relies on computer memory and is typically a
                low
                performance graphics component. Dedicated GPUs will includes its own processor and memory and will tend
                to
                be higher performing.</p>
            <p> Higher speed, higher capacity RAM in the graphics card will let it handle a more intense graphic load
                and do
                it quicker. This will allow for better, more fluid visuals. The card’s processor speed will be similarly
                important and can be looked at much the same as a computer’s processor. You can dig into the details and
                see
                how many shaders it has and what its core speed is, but in the end, it will probably be most valuable to
                check out a benchmark score that has evaluated its actual performance. To compare GPUs you can do a
                quick
                search on PassMark’s site for the graphics components in each.</p>

            <h2>Peripherals</h2>

            <p>USB: There is, thankfully, a standard that most computer peripherals opt to use, and it can be for
                anything
                from mouses and keyboards to hard drives and monitors. A modern version of USB, called USB 3.0, is
                faster
                than its predecessors, but there’s an even newer version of USB, called USB Type-C, which offers
                gigabits of
                bandwidth and the ability to handle enough current to power a laptop.</p>
            <p>An alternative for some major externals (like CD drives and hard drives) is to get a computer with an
                eSATA
                port, which will let you plug in those peripherals on the fly with high data transfer rates.</p>
            <p>HDMI: If you’re going to use your machine for entertainment, you’ll probably want an HDMI output. This
                will
                allow you to connect it to most modern televisions for a high-quality visual display, and it will also
                run
                the audio out if you’re planning to use the TV for sound.</p>
            <p>SD slot: If you work a lot with photography, an SD slot can be a handy way to get the files from your
                camera
                over to your computer. SD cards can even be used to speed up the system.</p>
            <h2>Gaming PC?</h2>
            <p>To play the latest games with the graphics on high (or ultra) and keep a high frame-rate, you’ll be
                needing
                to look into a truly high-performance machine. Modern games take up a lot of space, so a big hard drive
                is a
                must if you plan on having more than one game installed at a time — you’ll want it to be a fast drive,
                too.
                Running those games also takes a lot of processing power, so a heavy-hitting processor will be
                important.
                You can do without too many cores in your processor if each is extra-fast, but if you’re planning to
                play
                your games and keep other programs open in the background, consider bumping up the core count.</p>
            <p>You’ll need a dedicated graphics card, and a good one at that. You can probably get by with something in
                the
                mid-range of graphics cards, but a high-end card is your best bet. Make sure to get a high screen
                refresh
                rate 144Hz monitor to keep up with you FPS.</p>
            <p> Video RAM is just like a normal RAM, but video RAM’s job is to process the picture so that the monitor
                can
                show you the picture. All types of VRAMs are special arrangements for dynamic RAM. The video RAM is a
                buffer
                between the computer and the monitor. It is also called a frame buffer. When images are sent to display
                on
                the screen by the system, they are read by the processor onto the dedicated video RAM or integrated
                video
                RAM. Then the video is processed into the RAM and appears on the monitor. Be sure to get plenty of VRAM
                on
                that card.</p>
            <p> Lastly, Assess your budget and how you’ll be using your machine and you’ll find the right balance
                between
                price and performance. I hope this cleared up the technical jargon that surrounds these devices and
                gives
                you a smoother buying experience the next time you look at the specs.</p>
